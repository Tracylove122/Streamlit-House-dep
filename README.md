# House Price Prediction - Regression Projec

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict house prices based on several features using various regression algorithms. By analyzing factors such as area, number of rooms, location, and other relevant characteristics, we develop a model that can estimate house prices with high accuracy. The project is an excellent exercise in exploring regression techniques and evaluating their performance on real-world data.

Project Objective

### The goal of this project is to:

Explore and preprocess a dataset of housing features.
Apply various regression models to predict house prices.
Evaluate model performance using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R².
Use visualizations to interpret the relationships between different features and the target variable (house price).
Dataset
The dataset contains various features that influence house prices such as:

### Area (m²)
Number of Bedrooms
Location
Age of the Property
Number of Bathrooms
House Condition
Garage Size
Distance from City Center
You can download the dataset from this link (replace with the dataset link if publicly available).

Technologies Used
This project is implemented using the following technologies and libraries:

Python: The programming language used.
Streamlit: For creating an interactive web app to showcase the project.
Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
NumPy: For numerical calculations.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
Scikit-learn: For implementing regression models.
Git: For version control.
Jupyter Notebooks: Used during development for interactive coding.
Installation
To run the project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Tracylove122/House-Price-Regression.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd House-Price-Regression
Create a virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv project-env
Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows:
bash
Copy code
project-env\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:
bash
Copy code
source project-env/bin/activate
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To use the project, follow these steps:

Run the Streamlit application:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
Explore the interactive web application:

Use the sidebar to input the features (area, number of rooms, location, etc.).
The app will display the predicted house price and provide visualizations to better understand the relationships between variables.
Results
The best performing model achieved the following results:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): $X,XXX
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): $X,XXX
R² Score: 0.XX
Through feature engineering and model tuning, the final model was able to explain XX% of the variance in house prices.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of regression models in predicting house prices. It showcases the use of data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation to improve the accuracy of predictions. The results are visualized through an interactive web app built with Streamlit, providing users with a seamless experience to explore the data and model predictions.

Future work could involve experimenting with more advanced machine learning algorithms such as Gradient Boosting or Neural Networks and incorporating additional features like market trends.
